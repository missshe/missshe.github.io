<p class='words'>Hey, Huang Mengmeng! I'm learning javascript and jquery now. This is your birthday today, and chose this theme to practice my new skills. And HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!<br><br>
Remember the first time we came close to each other? Life is full of miracles and I'm lucky to have known you. You dramatically changed my life, and thank you for holding me when I'm broken. I missed your past two birthdays, and I don't know if I could be with you anymore next year. So this is my little gift, and a symble of our sweet friendship.
<br><br>
Best wishes for you. May you a bright future and happy love. May you find your direction of life and a good girl or boy to accompany you through the desert of life.
<br><br>
Again, thank god for my having you. </p>
<p class='honor'><br>For our forever-lasting friendship.<br>In honor of my beloved HMM.</p>
